# General Strategy

## Stage 1: Analytical Solution & Comparison

***Aim: finish by Week 1 (10/01 & 12/01); Result: produce derivation in Latex***

- solve analytically as a group 
- type up derivation 
- do some research on best numerical methods for Schrodinger eqn

***Aim: finish by Week 2 (17/01 & 19/01); Result: produce some code***

- start coding basic implementation to see if it works
- generalise basic implementation for later adaptation 

## Stage 2: Numerical Problems

***TBD***






## Stage 3: "Down the line":

- implement GUI
- allow to toggle between different methods
- visualise output as gif/3D 
- if possible, give options to toggle boundaries (infinite potential well, finite potential well, potential step...)
- higher dimensions??
- Coulomb potential?? Hydrogen atom, helium atom....
